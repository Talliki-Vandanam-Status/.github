# Talliki Vandanam Scheme 2025: Checking Payment Status and Updates

## Introduction
The Talliki Vandanam Scheme 2025, launched by the Andhra Pradesh government on June 12, 2025, is a flagship initiative under the "Super Six" promises of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP)-led NDA government. Translating to "Salutations to Mother," this welfare program provides financial assistance of ₹15,000 per year per child to mothers or guardians of students from Class 1 to Intermediate (Class 12) in recognized government, private aided, private unaided, and residential schools or junior colleges. Of this, ₹13,000 is credited directly to the mother’s Aadhaar-linked bank account, with ₹2,000 allocated for school development. With a budget of ₹8,745 crore, the scheme aims to benefit approximately 67 lakh mothers, reducing school dropout rates and supporting financially vulnerable families. This article provides a comprehensive guide to checking the Talliki Vandanam payment status, eligibility criteria, and recent updates, ensuring transparency and accessibility for beneficiaries.

## Common Issues and Solutions
Some beneficiaries have reported issues with payments, such as:
- **Payment Not Received**: This may be due to incorrect Aadhaar-linked bank accounts, incomplete eKYC, or eligibility verification issues. Solution: Visit the NBM portal to check status, ensure Aadhaar is linked to an active bank account, and file a grievance at the local Secretariat if needed.
- **Partial Payments**: Families with multiple children may receive funds for only one child. Solution: Raise a grievance via the NBM portal, selecting "Talliki Vandanam (FY 2025-26)" and specifying the issue.
- **Ineligibility**: Technical errors, such as incorrect electricity usage data, may lead to ineligibility. Solution: Verify updated eligibility on the NBM portal and contact the PGRS cell if listed as ineligible despite meeting criteria.

## Tips for Beneficiaries
- **Check Regularly**: Monitor the NBM portal or Secretariat notice boards for updates on payment status and beneficiary lists.
- **Ensure Aadhaar Linkage**: Confirm that the mother’s bank account is linked to her Aadhaar and verified by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI).
- **Maintain Attendance**: Ensure students maintain at least 75% attendance to remain eligible for the next academic year.
- **File Grievances Promptly**: Address issues like non-payment or ineligibility immediately through the GSWS portal or local Secretariat to expedite resolution.
